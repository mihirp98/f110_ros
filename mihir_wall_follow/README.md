# Wall Follow Algorithm

In this package, we implement a straightforward wall follow algorithm, such that the car follows the left wall while going around the race track.

## Usage

First launch the simulator using the command `roslaunch f110_simulator simulator.launch` and then launch the wall follow node with the command `rosrun mihir_wall_follow wall_follow`. If you want to launch AEB as well, you can use the command `rosrun mihir_safety safety_node`.

## Dependencies
- sensor_msgs
- ackermann_msgs
- f110_simulator
